# UFOs

## Overview

This web page is designed to provide the user with data and filters to examine a list of UFO sightings. By filtering the results you can look for patterns or other information that might indicate alien activity.

## Results

When the page is first loaded there are no filters applied so all the records are displayed.

![Unfiltered table of UFO sightings](<./Resources/unfiltered.png>)

To find all sightings on a specific date, type it into the date filter:

![UFO sightings filtered by date](<./Resources/date.png>)

To filter by location, type the name of a city, state, or country into the relevant filter:

![UFO sightings filtered by state](<./Resources/state.png>)

Filters can be combined to further narrow the results:

![UFO sightings filtered on multiple fields](<./Resources/multi.png>)

To see all results again simply delete the values in the filters.

## Summary

These filters are useful for exploring the data but they require names to be typed in exactly, in lowercase. This could be improved by making the filter values lowercase before comparing. Also, it might help if the user could filter on a date range or multiple locations, or select from a drop-down list for the shape.
